### Calculator Project

---

#### **Overview**
This project is a functional calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), modulo operation (`%`), and square calculations. Additional features include support for both decimal and whole numbers, an **AC (All Clear)** button to reset the input, and an **Equal** button to execute operations.

---

#### **Features**
1. **Arithmetic Operations**: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.
2. **Advanced Operations**:  
   - Modulo (`%`)  
   - Square of a number
3. **Input Reset**:  
   - **AC button** clears all input.
4. **Support for Decimal and Whole Numbers**: Perform operations seamlessly on any number type.
5. **User-Friendly Design**:  
   - Creative UI using **CSS Flexbox/Grid** and **Bootstrap**.
6. **Responsiveness**:  
   - Compatible across different devices and screen sizes.

---

#### **Technology Stack**
1. **HTML**: For structuring the calculator interface.
2. **CSS**:  
   - **Flexbox/Grid** for layout.  
   - **Bootstrap** for styling and responsiveness.
3. **JavaScript**:  
   - Event listeners for button interactions.  
   - Functions and logic for performing operations.

---

#### **Development Guidelines**
1. **JavaScript Concepts Used**:  
   - Event listeners for button clicks.  
   - Conditional statements (`if/else`) for operational logic.  
   - DOM manipulation (`innerText`/`innerHTML`) for dynamic updates.
2. **Readability**:  
   - Code is clean and well-commented for better understanding.
3. **Deployment**:  
   - Hosted on **GitHub** and made live using **Netlify**.
